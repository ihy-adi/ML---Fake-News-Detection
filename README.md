Fake News Detection Using Decision Trees and Naive Bayes


Here is the problem statement:
Create a fake news detection system by classifying news articles into fake or real using decision trees
and Naive Bayes. Analyze the impact of text preprocessing (tokenization, TF-IDF) on the performance of both
models.
