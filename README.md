# ML-Fake-News-Detection

Fake News Detection Using Decision Trees and Naive Bayes

Here is the problem statement:
Create a fake news detection system by classifying news articles into fake or real using decision trees
and Naive Bayes. Analyze the impact of text preprocessing (tokenization, TF-IDF) on the performance of both
models.

Software:
- Python
- Google Colab

How to run:
- Make sure that you have dataset files from the above link in a folder named "dataset" in the project directory before running the code.

Python modules required:
- sklearn (for confusion matrix and other performance metrics)
- nltk (for list of stopwords in english language)
- pandas (for data preprocessing)
- seaborn & matplotlib (for plotting the confusion matrix)
- Numpy for mathematics
